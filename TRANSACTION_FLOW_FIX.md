# Transaction Flow Improvements for External Wallets

## Problem
When users with external wallets (MetaMask, etc.) attempted to purchase player tokens, they experienced a confusing transaction flow:
1. User clicks "Confirm Purchase"
2. Approval transaction prompt appears
3. User approves
4. **Purchase transaction prompt doesn't appear or appears too quickly**

The user had to manually look for the second transaction prompt, which was confusing and led to incomplete purchases.

## Root Cause
The transaction flow was optimized for embedded wallets (seamless, no UI) but didn't provide enough feedback for external wallet users. Specifically:
- No status message between approval and purchase
- No indication that a second transaction was coming
- Purchase transaction initiated immediately after approval without user awareness

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Status Messaging
Added clear, step-by-step status updates throughout the transaction flow:

**For Buy Transactions:**
- `💰 Step 1/2: Approving USDC spending...` - Shows during approval
- `✅ Approval confirmed! Please confirm the purchase transaction...` - After approval succeeds
- `🛒 Step 2/2: Preparing purchase transaction...` - Before buy tx
- `🛒 Confirming purchase... Please check your wallet!` - During buy tx
- `⏳ Waiting for purchase confirmation...` - After buy tx sent
- `✅ Successfully bought player tokens!` - Success

**For Sell Transactions:**
- `💰 Confirming sale... Please check your wallet!` - During sell tx
- `⏳ Waiting for sale confirmation...` - After sell tx sent
- `✅ Successfully sold player tokens!` - Success

### 2. Added Delay Between Transactions
Added a 1.5 second delay after approval confirmation to:
- Give users time to see the approval success message
- Prepare them for the next wallet prompt
- Improve overall UX clarity

```typescript
// Update status to show approval succeeded and purchase is next
updateAlertState('pending', '✅ Approval confirmed! Please confirm the purchase transaction...', hash);

// Small delay to ensure user sees the approval success message
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
```

### 3. Clear User Guidance
Status messages now explicitly tell users to:
- Check their wallet
- Expect multiple transactions (Step 1/2, Step 2/2)
- Know what's happening at each stage

## Transaction Flow - Before vs After

### Before (Confusing)
```
User clicks "Confirm Purchase"
    ↓
MetaMask approval popup
    ↓
User approves
    ↓
[No clear feedback]
    ↓
MetaMask purchase popup (might be missed)
```

### After (Clear)
```
User clicks "Confirm Purchase"
    ↓
Status: "💰 Step 1/2: Approving USDC spending..."
    ↓
MetaMask approval popup appears
    ↓
User approves in MetaMask
    ↓
Status: "✅ Approval confirmed! Please confirm the purchase transaction..."
    ↓
[1.5 second delay]
    ↓
Status: "🛒 Step 2/2: Preparing purchase transaction..."
    ↓
Status: "🛒 Confirming purchase... Please check your wallet!"
    ↓
MetaMask purchase popup appears
    ↓
User approves in MetaMask
    ↓
Status: "⏳ Waiting for purchase confirmation..."
    ↓
Status: "✅ Successfully bought player tokens!"
```

## Code Changes

### File: `src/components/PlayerPurchaseModal.tsx`

#### 1. Enhanced `approveUSDC` function
```typescript
// Before
await sendTransactionWithWallet(transactionRequest);
await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });

// After
updateAlertState('pending', '⏳ Waiting for approval confirmation...', '');
const result = await sendTransactionWithWallet(transactionRequest);
await publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
updateAlertState('pending', '✅ Approval confirmed! Please confirm the purchase transaction...', hash);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
```

#### 2. Enhanced `buyTokens` function
```typescript
// Added step-by-step status updates
updateAlertState('pending', '💰 Step 1/2: Approving USDC spending...', '');
await approveUSDC(maxCurrencySpendBigInt);

updateAlertState('pending', '🛒 Step 2/2: Preparing purchase transaction...', '');
// ... prepare transaction ...

updateAlertState('pending', '🛒 Confirming purchase... Please check your wallet!', '');
const result = await sendTransactionWithWallet(transactionRequest);

updateAlertState('pending', '⏳ Waiting for purchase confirmation...', hash);
```

#### 3. Enhanced `sellTokens` function
```typescript
// Added clear status messaging
updateAlertState('pending', '💰 Confirming sale... Please check your wallet!', '');
const result = await sendTransactionWithWallet(transactionRequest);

updateAlertState('pending', '⏳ Waiting for sale confirmation...', hash);
```
